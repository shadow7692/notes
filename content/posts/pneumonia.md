### Aetiology

Infection of the lung tissue causing inflammation in the alveolar space.
- **Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)** develops in the community.
- **Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)** develops after more than 48 hours in a hospital.
- Ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP) develops in intubated patients in the intensive care unit.

**Aspiration pneumonia** develops due to the aspiration of food or fluids, usually in patients with impaired swallowing. Associated with anaerobic bacteria.

**Typical pneumonia** is commonly caused by _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, and less commonly _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_.

**Atypical pneumonia** is caused by organisms that cannot be cultured in the normal way or detected using a gram stain. 
- **Legionella pneumophila (Legionnaires’ disease)** is typically caused by inhaling infected water (e.g. air conditioning units), often after a cheap hotel holiday and hyponatraemia. A urine antigen test can be used as an initial screening test.
- **Chlamydophila psittaci (Psittacosis)** is associated with infected birds, often parrot owners.
- **Mycoplasma pneumoniae** also causes erythema multiforme, a rash characterised by varying-sized lesions with pink rings and pale centres. It can cause neurological symptoms in young patients.
- **Coxiella burnetii (Q fever)** is associated with animal bodily fluid exposure, often in farmers.

**Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP)** is a fungal pneumonia that occurs in immunocompromised patients. Usually presents subtly with a dry cough without sputum, shortness of breath on exertion and night sweats. Managed with co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). Patients with a low CD4 count are prescribed prophylactic co-trimoxazole.

**COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2)** can cause pneumonia, with varying symptoms including anosmia (loss of smell) is a clue to the diagnosis.

### Clinical Presentation

Common symptoms include cough (often with purulent sputum), dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain, fever, haemoptysis, fatigue, myalgia and weight loss.

Examination findings may include tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxia, and crackles on auscultation.

### Investigations

- **Posterioanterior (PA) chest x-ray** shows white patches of infiltrate, known as consolidation. Useful in detecting complications.
- **Full blood count (FBC)** shows raised white cell count (WCC).
- **C-reactive protein** is raised.
- **Sputum MC&S**.
- Pneumococcal and legionella **urinary antigen testing**.

### Management

Consider hospital admission if CRB-65 score > 0 in primary care, or [CURB-65 score]("https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/324/curb-65-score-pneumonia-severity") > 1 in hospital. If CURB-65 score > 2 consider ICU.

Low-severity community acquired pneumonia is managed with a 5 day course of amoxicillin¹ unless allergic, in which case clarithromycin or doxycycline.

Moderate and high-severity community acquired pneumonia is managed with a 7-10 day course of amoxicillin¹ and clarithromycin. unless allergic, in which case azithromycin or doxycycline.

Atypical pneumonia is managed with macrolides (e.g. clarithromycin), fluoroquinolones (e.g. levofloxacin) and tetracyclines (e.g. doxycycline).
​
### Complications

Pulmonary complications include pleural effusion, empyema, lung abscess, pneumothorax, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Extrapulmonary complications include sepsis, pericarditis, and acute kidney injury.
