### Aetiology

Excess fluid accumulation in the pleural cavity (space between the parietal and visceral pleural surfaces) of the thorax. Classified as either **transudative** (less than 30g/L protein) or **exudative** (more than 30g/L protein).

- Common **transudate** causes include heart failure, hypoalbuminaemia (e.g. liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, malabsorption), hypothyroidism, Meigs' syndrome.

- Common **exudate** causes include infection (e.g. pneumonia, tuberculosis), malignancy (e.g. lung cancer, mesothelioma), connective tissue disorders, pulmonary embolism, pancreatitis, Dressler's syndrome.

**Light's criteria** is used to differentiate between borderline cases, when protein is 25-35g/L.

### Clinical Presentation

Common symptoms include [dyspnoea]({{< ref "/tags/dyspnoea" >}}), non-productive [cough]({{< ref "/tags/cough" >}}) or [chest pain]({{< ref "/tags/chest-pain" >}}).

Classic examination findings include dullness to percussion, reduced breath sounds and reduced chest expansion.

### Investigations

- **Posterioanterior (PA) chest x-ray** shows blunting of the costophrenic angle, fluid in the lung fissures, meniscus in larger effusions, and tracheal and mediastinal deviation away from the effusion in very large effusions.

- **Contrast CT** can help identify underlying causes.

- **Ultrasound** can detect smaller effusions and increase the success probability of pleural fluid aspiration.

- **Pleural fluid analysis** includes testing for pH, protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), cytology and microbiology.

### Management

Approach based on underlying cause, options include:
- Recurrent aspiration.
- [Indwelling pleural catheter (IPC)](https://www.guysandstthomas.nhs.uk/health-information/indwelling-pleural-catheter-ipc).
- [Pleurodesis](https://www.guysandstthomas.nhs.uk/health-information/pleurodesis-using-chest-drain "Chest drain").
