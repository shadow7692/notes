### Aetiology

Chronic inflammation from irritants and oxidative stress cause thickening of the airway wall and destruction of alveoli leads to emphysema.

Risk factors include smoking tobacco, ageing, recurrent respiratory infections during childhood, genetic predisposition (e.g. alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency disorder), air pollution, and occupational irritant exposure.

### Clinical Presentation

Common symptoms include dyspnoea (initially exertional breathlessness), wheeze and productive cough.

### Investigations

- Post-bronchodilator spirometry to demonstrate airflow obstruction with FEV1/FVC ratio < 70%.
- Chest x-ray may show hyperinflation, bullae, flat hemidiaphragm.
- Full blood count to exclude secondary polycythaemia.
- BMI calculation.

### Management

General management involves smoking cessation, influenza and pneumococcal vaccination and pulmonary rehabilitation (exercise and education programme). 

**Bronchodilator therapy** involves a stepwise approach.
1. **Short-acting beta agonist (SABA)** or **short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA)**.
2. If patient does not experience asthmatic features or steroid responsiveness, add **long-acting beta agonist (LABA)** and **long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)**, otherwise add LABA and **inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)**.
3. Offer LAMA, LABA and ICS triple therapy.

Consider oral theophylline if inhaled therapy is not suitable, mucolytics if chronic productive cough, azithromycin prophylaxis, oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors if severe.

Perform ABGs on patients with FEV1 < 30% predicted.
- Offer **long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT)** if PaO₂ < 7.3 kPa, or PaO₂ < 8 plus secondary polycythaemia, peripheral oedema or pulmonary hypertension.

### Complications

Respiratory complications include acute COPD exacerbations, pneumothorax, and respiratory failure.

Other complications include pulmonary hypertension, secondary polycythaemia, muscle wasting and weakness.
