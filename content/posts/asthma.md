### Aetiology

Chronic inflammatory respiratory disorder secondary to IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, influenced by genetic predisposition, environmental triggers and immune response imbalance.

Risk factors include personal or family history of atopy (e.g. dermatitis, rhinitis), low birth weight, non-breastfed, maternal smoking, allergen exposure (e.g. dust, pollen, pets), air pollution, and [hygiene hypothesis]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene_hypothesis#:~:text=In%20medicine%2C%20the%20hygiene%20hypothesis,by%20strengthening%20the%20immune%20system.").

### Clinical Presentation

Common symptoms include dyspnoea, wheeze, cough and sometimes chest tightness.

### Investigations

In adults, consider occupational asthma specialist referral if sypmtoms improve on days away from work.
- Spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility (BDR) test.
- Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) test.

In children, only request FeNO test if spirometry is normal, or obstructive spirometry with negative BDR test.

### Management

Nonpharmacological advice includes smoking cessation, allergen avoidance and inhaler technique review. 

Pharmacological management involves a stepwise approach.
1. **Short-acting beta agonist (SABA)** for new diagnosis.
2. Add low-dose **inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)** (or if patient experiences symptoms > 3/week or night-time waking).
3. Add **leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA)**.
4. Either add or switch LTRA to **long-acting beta agonist (LABA)** depending on responsiveness.
5. Switch ICS and LABA to **maintenance and reliever therapy (MART)**, which includes a low-dose ICS (< 400 micrograms budeonside).
6. Switch low-dose MART to moderate-dose MART, or separate moderate-dose ICS and LABA.
7. Switch moderate-dose MART to high-dose ICS (> 800 micrograms), trial **long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA)**, or specialist referral.

Throughout this approach, patients will stay on SABA (e.g. salbutamol) +/- LTRA (e.g. montelukast).
