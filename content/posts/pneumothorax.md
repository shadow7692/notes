### Aetiology

Accumulation of air in the pleural cavity (space between the parietal and visceral pleural surfaces) of the thorax, resulting in partial or complete collapse of the affected lung.

- **Primary spontaenous pneumothorax** (PSP) occurs without underlying lung pathology, often in tall thin young men.

- **Secondary spontaenous pneumothorax** (SSP) occurs in patients with underlying lung pathology (e.g. COPD, asthma, cystic fibrosis, interstitial lung disease).

- **Traumatic pneumothorax** results from penetrating or blunt chest trauma.

- **Iatrogenic pneumothorax** occurs as a complication of medical procedures (e.g. thoracentesis, central venous catheter placement, mechanical ventilation, lung biopsy).

- **Tension pneumothorax** is a life-threatening condition in which a one-way valve is created that allows air to be drawn in to the pleural space during inspiration, and trapping air during expiration. This pressure is enough to deviate the mediastinum and cause cardiorespiratory arrest.

**Light's criteria** is used to differentiate between borderline cases, when protein is 25-35g/L.

### Clinical Presentation

Common symptoms include [dyspnoea]({{< ref "/tags/dyspnoea" >}}) and [pleuritic chest pain]({{< ref "/tags/pleuritic-chest-pain" >}}).

Examination findings may include diminished breath sounds, hyper resonance on percussion, and decreased chest wall movement on the affected side. In severe cases, patients may develop hypoxia, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension.

Tension pneumothorax may present with severe respiratory distress, tracheal deviation, jugular venous distension, and haemodynamic instability.

### Investigations

- **Posterioanterior (PA) chest x-ray** may show visceral pleural line and the absence of lung markings peripheral to the line.

- **Chest CT** can confirm the diagnosis if uncertain or inconclusive.

- **POCUS** is a useful tool for rapid bedside diagnosis.

### Management

Spontaenous pneumothorax is managed with **aspiration**.
- If no dyspnoea and <2cm air rim, consider discharge with follow-up.
- If apiration fails twice, a **chest drain** is required.

**Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)** is considered for recurrent pneumothorax or failed chest drain. 
- Abrasive or chemical **pleurodesis** to seal the pleural space by causing an inflammatory reaction.
- **Pleurectomy** to remove the pleura.

Tension pneumothorax is managed with **needle decompression**, by inserting a large bore (14-16 gauge) cannula into the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line.

Discharge advice includes smoking cessation, avoid flying for two-weeks, and scuba diving permaban unless bilateral pleurectomy with normal postoperative lung function and CT.
